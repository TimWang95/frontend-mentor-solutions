          honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
          <p class="testimanials__content__bottom">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
          people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled
          shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
          I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

          <p class="testimanials__content__bottom">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
          confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
          above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

          <p class="testimanials__content__bottom">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
          help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
          wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
          never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
          the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
          multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
